# 🚀 **Project Theme: Real-Time Healthcare Analytics Platform**

Throughout 15 days, I will build a complete **IoT-based Healthcare Data Engineering solution**, including:

* Streaming ingestion from Kafka
* Batch + Stream processing in Databricks
* Curated warehouse in Snowflake
* Data quality checks with Great Expectations
* Orchestration with Airflow
* Cloud components from Azure, AWS, and GCP
* Power BI dashboard on top of Snowflake
* ML integration using MLflow (forecasting/alerting)

This will serve as a **production-ready portfolio project**.
